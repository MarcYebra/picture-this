      <p>Hi, my name is Marc Yebra and I'm the engineer behind this web application. Before making the decision of becoming a full-stack developer,
        I spent the previous five years running my own photography business. I understand the difficulties photographers face when trying to grow a client list/network.
        Fortunately, I had the pleasure of working with many clients which allowed me to understand how challenging it can be for clients to find the right photographer
        for their projects or events. Combing the struggles from both parties, Picture This was born.
